##American Robin
* **Common Name:** American Robin
* **Scientific Name:** Turdus migratorius
* **Date Sighted:** 2011-04-22
* **Location of sighting:** Longmont, Colorado
* **Notes:** This crew of Robins was enjoying in the snow on the grounds outside our house in Longmont, Colorado.  It was a late spring snow, so many flowers were in full bloom. How great to have blooming flowers, snow, and Robins too!
