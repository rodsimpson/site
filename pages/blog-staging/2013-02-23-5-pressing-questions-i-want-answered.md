#What happened to TV?
TV has really been woefully disappointing lately. With the exception of [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/), there just isn't much quality to be found.  The CSIs and Bones have all morphed into shock-o-rama gore-fests (don't believe me? Go back and watch season 1 from either show). Even fun shows like the Mentalist seem to routinely drift into depressing or just unpleasant territory on a fairly regular basis (please tidy up the whole Red John thing, we are all so over it).

So what does all this mean?  It means we have been going into the archives looking for anything worth watching, and all we found was a show called Ancient Aliens. At first, the show was completely ridiculous.  The people on the show are a little whacky, and their theories, well you have to wonder.  But they have raised some very interesting questions.  

Most interesting to me was: why did people stop building really big things out of really big pieces of stone?

#The mystery
It really is perplexing.  All over the world we find giant structures that were built out of hunks of rock the size of school buses.  Ancient man seemed to build them like they were sand castles. Yet at some point, we just stopped. Even more curious is that  it isn't as if we simply transitioned from using giant stones to using steel and concrete. No.  We simply stopped.

#Building techniques
Theories on how ancient structures were built vary widely.  People dragging big blocks with ropes, 

Wikipedia even says that it only took the Egyptians somewhere between 10 and 20 years to build the great pyramid. 


I think one way to approach it is to think about the math.  Apparently, there are roughly 2.3 million limestone blocks were used to build the great pyramid, and it took 10-20 years.  Let's break that down:

60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 = 31536000 seconds in 10 years
------------------------------------------------------  = 13.7
                  2,300,000 stones

1 stone lain every 13.7 seconds, 24 hours per day, nonstop for 10 years.

or

1 stone lain every 27.4 seconds, 24 hours per day, nonstop for 20 years.

How is that even possible?





### 2. Did we really go to the moon in the late 60's early 70's?



### 3. Who really shot JFK?



### 4. Extra terrestrials - have we / are we visited by extra terrestrials?
Roswell, Crop circles, UFO sightings, abductionsâ€¦ The list goes on and on.  

### 5.
