      <h3>Good light is hard to find</h3>
      <p>
      I love capturing the world around me.  No subject is off limits and although I frequently capture images of nature, man-made objects can also be beautiful.  Mainly, I just try to find good light.
      </p>
      <p>
      Good light is imperative, because photography is the capture of light.  The quality of light is what separates the wonderful from the ordinary.  The best light is fleeting: at the edge of storms, the warm evening light, the crisp morning light. Even in our digital world, with technologies like camera RAW and programs like Photoshop, you cannot reliably create light that did not exist when the photo was taken.

      <h3>My goal: make something interesting</h3>
      <p>
      While working on my degree in Fine Arts, I was trained as a painter. I learned a lot of things about pictures: composition, color, structure, tension, depth, leading lines, overlap, juxtaposition, and so much more. All of these principles apply to photography, yet photographers don’t start with a blank canvas.  Instead, we must seek out our images and then use limited tools to push and pull the image into a final product.
      </p>
      <p>But the end goal is the same: make something interesting.</p>
      <p>
      And so this is what I strive for. I don’t’ feel I need to stay true to the original scene. Instead, I work to create fun and engaging images that viewers will enjoy.  Back in the virtual darkroom, each new photo is only the raw material for the finished piece. I work with the image, trying different crops, different filters, overlays, temperatures, different combinations of techniques, all to find the most compelling final image.  Sometimes I get something worthwhile, often I just move on to the next image.
      </p>
      <p>
      Here in my gallery, I have selected a few of the images that I felt were successful.  Some more than others, but hopefully they are fun to look at and maybe even interesting. I hope you enjoy the viewing as much as I enjoyed the making.
