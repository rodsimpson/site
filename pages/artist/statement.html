         My name is Rod Simpson and I am a Boulder-based photographer interested in many genres of photography including (but not limited to) landscape, macro, night, food, and product. I first learned the art of photography when my mom (who is so awesome!) gave me an all-manual Pentax K-1000 film camera. I enjoyed several years of photography classes and did quite bit of black and white work, but was eventually captivated by other interests (guitar, painting, illustration).

         After attending the Savannah College of Art and Design for several years, I went on to earn a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from the University of Florida. I traveled and just enjoyed life for a while and eventually returned to the University of Florida to complete a Master's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering. I met my wonderful wife Mary and we were married soon after.

         Several years later, we were living in Crested Butte, Colorado, and Mary was really doing a lot of photography. I wanted to join her on her landscape excursions, so she gave me her Camera when she upgraded. We spent many months out shooting the beautiful landscapes around Crested Butte and I was hooked again!

         The Fall and Spring are my favorite times of the year for making pictures, especially here in Colorado. With everything from Aspen to Cottonwoods, Columbine to Indian Paintbrush, Colorado has some of the most amazing landscape opportunities in world.

         Currently, my wife Mary and I continue to explore Colorado and many other wonderful states in search of new, exciting images. I would love to hear from any fellow photographers, and I hope to see you all out on the trail!
