         The Arts have been a part of my life since my youth.  My mother would hang giant swaths of computer paper on the walls and my brother and I would spend hours drawing starships and airplanes.  In high school I spent most of my free time in the schools art room and received the highest score available on my AP portfolio.  I also took several years of black and white photography where I learned the ropes on a manual Pentax K-1000 film camera. I had many of my photos published in the high school newspaper and the senior yearbook.   From there it was off to the Savannah College of Art and Design, where I majored in illustration.

         After several amazing years, I transferred to the University of Florida.  In 1996, I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a major in painting.  Since that time I have been involved in art in various capacities, but it wasn’t until 2008 that I was re-introduced to photography.  We moved to Crested Butte, Colorado and my wife Mary was busy photographing all the amazing scenery.  I was inspired to pick up the camera once again and haven’t looked back since.

         Much had cha nged since my days in the darkroom with black and white film.  But I eagerly read everything I could and practiced as much as possible.  Photography swept into my life like a cool breeze on a summer afternoon; it has been a wonderful experience.  Mary and I always spend as much time as possible out in nature, taking photos and loving life.  I hope you enjoy viewing these photos as much as I have enjoyed taking them.
