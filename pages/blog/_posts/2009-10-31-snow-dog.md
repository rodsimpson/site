#Dog Photography
So I just love taking pictures of our dogs! This one is of Moab. We were out in front of Mt. Gothic in Crested Butte. The dogs were running around like crazy so I set the camera to TV and a fast shutter speed (1/250), and snapped away. This one seemed to have some things going for it (happy dog, in focus, tongue out, nice pose. If I could do it again, I would have stopped down a bit more to blur the backgroundâ€¦ But I am always learning!
