###Toys! (or are they?)
I recently posted a new <a href="/pages/artist/photography_gallery.html">Toys gallery</a>.  All of the photos in the gallery are of toys except one. In this post, we will see how to achieve a "toy" effect using the blur filter in Photoshop.

###Toys are interesting
There is something compelling about photographing toys.  Ideally, these ordinary objects can help to produce photos that play games with perception. By being both realistic and unreal at the same time, photos of toys have a certain duality that is interesting.

###Why do toy photos look so distinct?
When we look at professional photos of toys, they typically feature a shallow depth of field. What this means is that there is a very limited portion of the photo that is in focus. In the photo above, notice that only a small portion of the car's roof is really in sharp focus.  The rest of the scene is blurry.

###Make full sized things look like toys
This is a pretty neat effect that is easy to achieve.  You don't need to worry about trying to achieve a shallow depth of field in-camera.  Instead, you can achieve this same effect using photoshop.  Simply add a blur to the top and bottom of an image.  The effect works best when the vantage point of the scene is from above (so you are looking down on the subject).

The photo above, of the car, is in fact a toy; the one below is not. These are real houses.  This photo was actually taken from the dirt road on Brush Creek in Crested Butte (looking south).
