#Mac Mouse Problem (and solution!)
About a year ago, my wireless Mac mouse started acting up. In this post I describe the simple solution that I used to fix it.  Maybe it will work for you, maybe not.  Either way, it is about the easiest thing you can possibly try.

**Note:** If you don't want to read the whole post, just scroll to the bottom and read the recap for the solution.

##The symptoms
The mouse would work fine for a while.  But randomly, it would become very unresponsive. The cursor on the screen would either stay in one place, jump around, or move very slowly. The behavior was as if the computer's CPU (a macbook pro) was running at 100% and the mouse just wasn't responding.

Oddly, when all this was going in, the touchpad always worked perfectly.

##Searching for solutions
I tried all sorts of things.  I changed mouse batteries.  I exchanged my mouse for a new one at the Apple Store (they are so awesome!). I unplugged and then completely turned off the cordless phone.  I moved my cell phone to the next room.  I turned my cell phone off completely.  I changed the channel on my router.  I turned off my router.  I exchanged my mouse for a new one (again). I added more ram.  I checked the activity monitor. I killed all running programs. I hired a witch doctor.  I practiced Zen meditation.

Sometimes any one of these things appeared to fix the problem, but unfortunately, it never seemed to be the same solution.  And worse, the problem always seemed to return soon. About the only thing that would always fix it was a complete reboot. But even that was only temporarily. In hours or days, I would have the same problem again.

##No mas!
So after dealing with this for 6 months, I thought I had tried everything.  But one day it occurred to me to flip the mouse over and examine the laser area.  The optics are recessed into the housing and appeared to be clean. Randomly, I ran my finger back and forth across the front of the hole in the housing.  I was kind of irritated, so I did this quickly, probably 8 or 9 times.

##Eureka!
When I set the mouse back on the table, it was working again.  I assumed it was another false positive, but oddly, I didn't have the problem again for quite a while.  When it did happen again about three weeks later, I repeated the procedure and boom!  It worked again.  I have now had to do this about 4 times in the last six months.  Each time it worked, and each time it seems like it is longer before it starts acting up again.

##Recap
So I have no idea why this works.  Just pick up the mouse and swipe your finger back and forth across the laser hole on the bottom of the mouse.  Do it quickly, about 9-10 times (not an exact science).

Maybe there is some telemetry cache in the mouse that gets all wonky.  Or maybe, that witch doctor paid off after all.  Who knows, but maybe it will help you too.
