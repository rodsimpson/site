##In a galaxy far, far away…
When I was about 13, my mother bought me a TRS 80 color computer.  It was the most awesome thing I had ever seen. For several years I programmed in Basic, creating games and primitive drawing programs in the wee hours of the night.  Each summer I took computer classes, and during the year, I spent all my money on programming books and tapes (yes we stored our code on cassettes back in the day) that I ordered from the back of magazines.

Unfortunately, when I got to high school, I went up against Mr. Smithers - the gym-coach-turned-computer-teacher.  He didn't know jack about programming and had no idea what to do with me (gotta love the public school system). He was trying to teach me how to write a program to print my name on the screen; I was trying to write Zork.  We had failure to communicate and I quickly lost patience.  It didn't help that I also discovered the electric guitar. And girls.  All of which pulled me away from computers and sent me down a more [artistic](/2012/10/07/rod-simpson-photography-history/) path.

##A new hope…
Fast forward about 10 years and we find me in Portland, Oregon working as a house painter (yeah, that Fine Arts degree sure worked out).  One afternoon I was up on a ladder wearing a full Tyvek suit, painting a duplex, and sweating like an english sheepdog in the middle of summer.  It was miserable.  But as I was getting ready to knock off for the day, I saw a beacon of hope just across the fence.  It was an Intel campus.  Jones Farm, to be exact. Clean, happy people floated across the parking lot to beamers and benzes. That vision was life-altering.

##Return of the Jedi (Really? You're going to keep this going?)
That night I had a long talk with my mom about going back to school for computer science.  Within just a few weeks, I was loading up my stuff and heading back to Gainesville, Florida.  I didn't know if I would get in the program, but I knew I was done painting houses.

After a year of taking lots of math (no calc series for fine arts) and other programming classes, I finally got into the Master's program in the College of Engineering. I loved it! Lots of programming and learning new things. The biggest irony was that I ended up doing a nine-month internship with Intel at the Jones Farm campus - the exact one I had seen over the fence several years earlier.

Everything worked out perfectly. I met my future wife, graduated with honors, and we started our own business [Bark! Multimedia](http://barkmultimedia.com). We had a lot of fun working together on the business, but once Bark! Multimedia was doing well, my wife took over.  I went to work for Health Plan Services as a server-side developer.

##The Empire strikes back
After 6 years of working in the insurance industry, they finally managed to break me. They won. I was burned out, uninspired, and basically numb with respect to programming. Then, out of the blue, I got a call from a former colleague and good friend [Tom Stovall](http://www.stovak.net/) (his [blog](http://www.stovak.net/) is hilarious, btw).

Long story short, this past January I accepted an amazing job with Apigee,  and have not looked back.  I have found inspiration in a company that encourages innovation, and celebrates your enthusiasm.  I have continued to do web development (I just finished a javascript [SDK for Apigee's App Services](http://blog.apigee.com/detail/javascript_sdk_building_html5_apps_just_got_easier)), and have also been able to do a lot of [writing](/pages/writer/writing.html) for their [website](http://apigee.com) and for my project's [docs](http://apigee.com/docs/app_services) site.

Anyway, I love programming, which is why I made this site the most difficult way possible.  I installed Ruby and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a myriad of other gems, all so I could build out an all static site that could make the kessel run in under 12 parsecs.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts.

…may the force be with you.
