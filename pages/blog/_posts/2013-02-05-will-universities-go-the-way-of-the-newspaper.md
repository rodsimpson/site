###"*The times, they are a-changin'.*"

Spoken all the way back in 1964, the famous folk guitarist, [Bob Dylan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin'), was ahead of his time.  There's no denying that technology has been marching forward at an alarming pace, but what will this mean for higher education?  Will Universities will suffer the same dismal fate endured by so many newspapers over the last five years?

#The state of the Union
Over the last decade, extreme technological advances have dictated that companies must adapt or become obsolete. The newspaper industry has been no exception. By the middle of 2009, [more than 105 newspapers had closed their doors](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-death-of-the-american-newspaper-2009-7?op=1). In [2010 and 2011 more than 300 newspapers were forced to shut their doors](http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/152_newspapers_shut_down_in_2011_10536.aspx).  Here on the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, we bemoaned the loss of our excellent paper, the [Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/).

The reason for all this is clear today: newspapers that failed didn't adapt quickly enough in the face of the changing habits of their readership.

#The New Media
With few exceptions, the Old Media (read: local papers), served local markets.  Conversely, the New Media didn't care about locality.  The New Media recognized that physical delivery to a narrow local market wasn't the future. This new breed of media outlet was lighter and more nimble. Basically, the New Media beat the Old Media to the web; they embraced technology and cast off the shackles of traditional thinking.

A perfect example is the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/), which opened its virtual doors in 2005. This outlet has thrived, while so many much more established outlets have shut their doors.

The New Media doesn't concern itself with the old ways and doesn't care about the old revenue streams.  Their whole business model was geared towards the web and digital delivery. They thrived when others suffered.


#A corollary in education?
Could New Education replace Old Education just like what happened with the media? This notion has been suggested by several authors ([1](http://chronicle.com/article/What-Colleges-Should-Learn/15693) [2](http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/09/01/309988/bold-prediction-of-the-day-universities-are-the-new-newspapers/?mobile=nc)), and we are [already seeing shifts](http://chronicle.com/article/Tomorrows-College/125120/) in how students are educated. Technology is rapidly changing [how students go to school](http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/More-elite-universities-offer-free-online-courses-4295976.php), with many colleges offering a mix of traditional and online courses. Even hallowed institutions like Harvard and MIT have ventured into virtual education with an offering called [edX](https://www.edx.org/); currently a non-profit venture with no accredidation.

Even more interesting is the emergence of silicon valley startups like [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).  These companies have very strong views about what education will look like in the future, and it isn't dorms and classrooms, it is 100% virtual. Their courses are currently free, but make no mistake, [they are definitely for-profit enterprises](http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/coursera-adds-29-schools-90-courses-and-4-new-languages-to-its-online-learning-platform/).  With [generous venture capital](http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/18/coursera-raises-16m/) behind them, these private companies clearly smell blood in the water.

With so many colleges, universities, and private companies rushing to get online, what will this mean for traditional brick and mortar institutions?  Are we about to witness the mass newspaper extinctions play out all over again?

#The final mile
Traditional media has had "the wire" for many decades.  National and international stories were relayed across "the wire" to local newspapers.  These institutions then took great care to aggregate the various stories together into the most compelling arrangement possible. They printed it, and then delivered it "the final mile" to their reader's homes and businesses.  It was this "final mile" problem, getting the news from the wire to the people, that made newspapers relevant on a national stage.

But then, everyone got "the wire" run directly to their homes.  Access to the internet meant that readers could get the news directly.

#Education's final mile
So what is the "final mile" equivalent in education?  It is the process of getting the information from professors and books into the students minds.  This is done through a combination of lectures, tests, and discussions or labs.  Traditionally, students had to physically go to the school to complete these tasks.

It is now technologically possible for all of these activities to be accomplished online. Even in small community colleges, it has become commonplace for lectures to be recorded and made available to students online. Virtual test-taking is trivial to implement, and in some cases, has been in use for years. Even most discussions and labs can be run using video conferencing.

This is exactly the technology that [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and [edX](https://www.edx.org/) are using.  The only thing that is missing from their programs is accreditation, which they are all working on. In fact, there are already a number of colleges that already offer fully accredited online programs, like [Western Governors University](http://www.wgu.edu/) or [Concordia University](http://www.cu-portland.edu/) in Portland.

#Do I really need to go to class?
This is the question students will be asking themselves as they contemplate their collective collegiate paths in the near future. Online-only programs are inherently less expensive, and may offer a much wider array of choices for coursework, and ultimately, a major. Will students spend $10,000 - $12,000 per year to go to their local, lesser-known college? Or will they decide to spend less than half that amount, ([$2000-$4000](http://www.wgu.edu/tuition_financial_aid/tuition)), to attend an online program?

#Leveraging economies of scale
Digital news outlets can serve exponentially more readers than their paper-based counterparts. The cost increases associated with serving a thousand readers versus a million readers is negligible. Once the delivery infrastructure is in place and the content has been created, adding a few more servers to handle the load is a small fraction of the overall costs.

This economy of scale works well for news outlets, and it only serves to further reinforce their name power and the associated trust in the stories they provide. The more people that get their news from a particular outlet, the stronger that outlet's brand will become.  Could Universities also take advantage of this same phenomenon?

#The business of trust
One could argue that, like newspapers, colleges and universities are in the business of trust. A degree from Harvard carries a certain level of trust, much like a story from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times does (political slants aside). In other words, because of their reputation, we believe in the competence of a degree-holder from an Ivy League school just as we believe the established media outlet's feature story.

But this is true for different reasons.  For newspapers, a long track record of solid reporting creates this trust.  Conversely, for top-tier schools, it is their exclusivity. Because they only admit the select few at the top of the educational food-chain, their degrees are coveted.

#The Ivy League can't go mainstream.
What would happen if Harvard decided to admin an extra one-hundred thousand students? Would it dilute the Harvard brand?  What if they increased their ranks by an extra million?  It sounds far-fetched.  But by leveraging technology, Stanford professors Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun were able to [teach artificial intelligence to over 100,000 students](
http://singularityhub.com/2011/08/18/100000-sign-up-for-stanfords-open-class-on-artificial-intelligence-classes-with-1-million-next/).

Keep in mind that this was just a single class and not a full degree program, but it seems to suggest that massive enrollment numbers are possible.  But how does this affect a school's brand? At some point, too many graduates with degrees from Harvard would dilute the brand and negatively impact the perceived trust embodied in a degree from such a venerated institution.

The elites must maintain the air of exclusivity to survive and remain relevant. Of course they will adapt technologies to improve the quality of education they offer and to reduce costs, but they will never take full advantage of the economies of scale (at least not for accredited degrees).

#So who has to worry?
It seems, at least for now, that the top-tier, bellwether institutions are not the organizations in immediate danger. Instead, a stratification of institutions seems the most likely:

*Elite top-tier Ivy League schools will operate largely as they always have, with technology simply providing flexibility to students and cost-savings to the institutions.*

*Well known state and private universities will use technology to enable them to swell their ranks to absorb the smaller colleges and especially community colleges.*

*New private institutions such as [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) will compete with existing upper tier schools for enrollment, and will be the nail in the coffin for the small schools.*

*Small colleges and universities will find that they are unable to compete with the brand recognition of middle and upper-middle class institutions, while most community colleges will simply close.*

#Education choices
As online programs begin to pick up steam, and full accreditation becomes commonplace, students will naturally gravitate towards the institutions that offer the most for their education dollars. Name and reputation will continue to drive education decisions, with students choosing schools that offer the best name brand / value proposition combination.

The one thing students won't care about is **location**. This puts the small local community colleges squarely on the chopping block, followed by lesser-known colleges and universities. These schools won't be able to compete with the upper-tier school's name brands, and they definitely won't be able to compete on price.

#The future
There is no question that we are in the midst of a very significant shift in education.  In the next decade we will likely begin to see lower-tier institutions shutting their doors or making dramatic cuts to their campus sizes, while the middle tier universities grow their online enrollments to absorb the shift.

The real question seems to be: will all this hubbub actually result in better education? Only time will tell.
