##A discovery
I was recently visiting my mother's house, and while cleaning out some old boxes, I came across several "books" that I made as a tyke. These weren't exactly [Pulitzer](http://www.pulitzer.org/) candidates, and with such pedestrian titles as "The Bean Man", about a man who collected beans, and "The Spaceship Man", about a man who lives on a spaceship, I am not sure why I even made them.  Ok, I do know.  They were really fun to make; especially with no editorial review!  

##What was most important was the experience.  
There is nothing better than spending hours on end pounding away at the keyboard only to realize that everything you wrote is terrible and should be deleted immediately.  How satisfying, right?  Well, I must love it because in 2009, I participated for the first time in the National Novel Writing Month ([NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/)).  

Some of you may wonder what this ([NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/)) business is.  I will tell you.  It is hell.  A fun sort of hell, with lots of snacks, high highs (how awesome - the princess is really a stock-car driver), and low lows(wait! the princess can't drive stick).  For a solid month (every November), about half a million crazy people lock themselves in basements and set up camp in coffee shops while they foolishly attempt to write 50,000 (not a type-o, that is Fifty-Thousand) words in just 30 days.  They could have at least picked a month with 31 days!

##Bring on the pain!
I did this.  Twice.  The first time, in 2009 as previously mentioned, I only made it to 20,000 words before the insanity got the best of me.  I tucked my tail between my legs and vowed to try again.  And sure enough, stupid me, I tried again in 2010 - and succeeded!!  Oh happy day!  Fifty-thousand rambling words about nothing.  It wasn't all for naught, because they did give me this nifty winner's badge:

Actually it wasn't that bad.  I really had a great time and my wife, Mary, was very supportive.  After a month of struggle, I felt that I had a nice foundation for a novel.  I have been revising it since then and hope to have it finished by sometime in mid 2085 or so (give or take 20 years).

##My day job
I also currently enjoy the great fortune of working for [Apigee](http://apigee.com), an awesome company that has encouraged me to create articles for their website.  Most of these discuss the projects that I work on and are fairly technical.  I also get to contribute to the documentation of the product.  I actually really enjoy this and have been mentored by some really great technical writers (there are lots of really smart people working at [Apigee](http://apigee.com).

##Keep writing
What I have learned is that you just have to keep writing.  Just like [photography](/2012/10/07/rod-simpson-photography-history/), you will never get the amazing picture if you don't keep going out and taking photos.  Of course, they also say that about the lottery...
