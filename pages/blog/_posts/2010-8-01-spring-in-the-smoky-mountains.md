#Trip Report
Well, we had a fantastic time in the Great Smoky Mountains! Spring was amazing, and we seemed to catch the season just right. Many of the Dogwood trees were still in bloom and the whole area was just amazing. The park service still had several roads closed, including Roaring Fork, but the new Cadeâ€™s Cove loop road was finished. Overall it was a very productive trip, and I posted a new gallery, which can be seen [here](http://rodsimpson.com/pages/artist/photography_gallery.html).
