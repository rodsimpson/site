##In a galaxy far, far away…
When I was about 13, my mother bought me a TRS 80 color computer.  It was the most awesome thing I had ever known. For several years I programmed in Basic, creating games and primitive drawing programs in the wee hours of the night.  Each summer I took computer classes and during the year, I spent all my money on programming books and tapes (yes we stored our code on cassettes back in the day) that I ordered from the back of magazines.

Unfortunately, when I got to high school, I came up against Mr. Smithers.  He didn't know jack about programming and didn't know what to do with me at all.  I quickly grew bored as he was trying to teach me how to print my name on the screen, while I was trying to write Zork.  We had failure to communicate and I quickly lost patience.  I also discovered the electric guitar… and girls.  

##A new hope…
Fast forward about 20 years and we find me in Portland, Oregon working as a house painter (yeah, that Fine Arts degree sure worked out).  One afternoon I was up on a ladder wearing a full Tyvek suit, painting a duplex, and sweating like an english sheepdog in the middle of summer.  It was miserable, but then across the fence, I saw a beacon of hope.  It was an Intel campus.  Jones Farm, to be exact.  

##Return of the Jedi (really, you're going to keep this going?)
That night I had a long talk with my mom about going back to school for computer science.  Within just a few weeks, I was loading up my stuff and headed back to Gainesville, Florida.  I didn't even know if I would be able to get in, but I knew I was done painting houses. 

After taking lots of math (no calc series for fine arts) and various other classes, I got into the Master's program in the College of Engineering.  The biggest irony was that I ended up doing a nine-month internship with Intel at the Jones Farm campus - the exact one I had seen over the fence several years earlier.  

Everything worked out great, I met my future wife, graduated, and we started our own business [Bark! Multimedia](http://barkmultimedia.com).  Once Bark! Multimedia was up and running, my wife took over full time and I went to work for Health Plan Services as a server-side developer.  

##The Empire strikes back
After 6 years of working in the insurance industry, they finally managed to break me. They had won.  I was burned out, uninspired, and basically numb with respect to programming.  Then, out of the blue, I got a call from a former colleague and good friend [Tom Stovall](http://www.stovak.net/) (his [blog](http://www.stovak.net/) is hilarious, btw). 

Long story short, this past January I accepted an amazing job with Apigee, Corp and have not looked back.  I have found inspiration in a company that encourages innovation, and celebrates your enthusiasm.  I have continued to do web development (I just finished a javascript [SDK for Apigee's App Services](http://blog.apigee.com/detail/javascript_sdk_building_html5_apps_just_got_easier)), and have also been able to do a lot of [writing](/pages/writer/writing.html) for their [website](http://apigee.com) and for my project's [docs](http://apigee.com/docs/app_services) site.  

Anyway, I love programming, which is why I made this site the most difficult way possible.  I installed Ruby and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a myriad of other gems, all so I could build out an all static site to do my evil bidding.  

…and may the force be with you.
