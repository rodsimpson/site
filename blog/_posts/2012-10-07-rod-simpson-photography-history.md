##How photography became a serious part of my life
The Arts have been a part of my life since my youth.  My mother would hang giant swaths of computer paper on the walls and my brother and I would spend hours drawing starships and airplanes.  In high school I spent most of my free time in the schools art room and received the highest score available on my AP portfolio.  I also took several years of black and white photography where I learned the ropes on a manual Pentax K-1000 film camera. I had many of my photos published in the high school newspaper and the senior yearbook.

But if I wasn’t doing art, I was busy practicing my other artistic passion – the electric guitar.  I played in many bands, some large and electric, other small an intimate.  But soon high school was over and it was off to the Savannah College of Art and Design, where I majored in illustration.  I also discovered Jazz and the upright bass.  I was soon the proud owner of a 1956 Jusek, which I played for years.

After several amazing years in Savannah, I transferred to the University of Florida.  In 1996, I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a major in painting.  I was fortunate enough to have as a friend and mentor, [Jerry Cutler](http://plaza.ufl.edu/jcutler/index.html), who taught me to see.  My other mentor was [Richard Hiepp](http://www.richardheipp.com/), who is awesome.  He taught me how to think.

Since that time I have been involved in art in various capacities, but it wasn’t until 2008 that I was re-introduced to photography.  We moved to Crested Butte, Colorado and my wife Mary was busy photographing all the amazing scenery.  I was inspired to pick up the camera once again and haven’t looked back since.

Much had changed since my days in the darkroom with black and white film.  But I eagerly read everything I could and practiced as much as possible.  Photography swept into my life like a cool breeze on a summer afternoon; it has been a wonderful experience.  Mary and I always spend as much time as possible out in nature, taking photos and loving life.  I hope you enjoy viewing these photos as much as I have enjoyed taking them.
