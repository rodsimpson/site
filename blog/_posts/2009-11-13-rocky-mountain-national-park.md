#Trip Report
Mary and I enjoyed another great excursion to Rocky Mountain National Park yesterday.  The weather was frigid and we were hoping for some evening shots at Bear Lake.  But by the time we got to to the lake it was blowing about 30 knots and the snow was flying all around.  We hiked up to Emerald lake to check things out, and although it was beautiful, no photo ops.  We did make the obligatory stop at a nice herd of elk and got some shots.   Mary was trying out a 2x tele-extender.  I was just using the 70-200mm (which was fine since the elk were right next to the road).  All in all, a nice little break!
