So one of my favorite things to do is to photgraph my dog Rio with her head out the window. I have shot probably around 1000 images trying to get memorable ones.  There have been some decent ones, but none with all ingredients: Happy dog + nice background + bokeh + sunshine + proper exposure! Happily, I got one on our last trip.  She is sitting here next to me while I post this and says woof (translation: where's my dinner?).
